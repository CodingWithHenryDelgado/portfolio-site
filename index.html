                    <h3>Zendesk Implementation</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I significantly improved the customer service experience for Center Centre by
                        implementing Zendesk into our routine. To start, I researched multiple customer service software
                        options and ultimately chose Zendesk for its efficiency and user-friendly interface.
                        <br><br>
                        After choosing the software, I taught the company how to use it effectively and created
                        documentation and videos for future fellows. By doing so, I was able to streamline the feedback
                        process and improve communication within the team. Additionally, I implemented triggers to keep
                        us alerted of any issues that needed attention.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the implementation of Zendesk resulted in a much smoother and efficient customer
                        service experience for our team and users alike.

                <h3>Center Centre Intensive Page</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my responsibilities at Center Centre, I was tasked with building the landing page for the
                    upcoming Intensive event, which was set to take place on February 6th. The project involved creating
                    a landing page and middle pages using content provided by Jared Spool and Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman.
                    To ensure a seamless user experience, I connected the middle pages to the checkout pages that my
                    co-fellow, Amy Spencer, created!

                    <br /> <br />
                    To automate the purchase process, I used Zapier to send dynamic receipts to users and update the
                    number of available seats on the landing page once a package was purchased. This workflow was
                    thoroughly tested by Marko, Amy, Shayne, and me to ensure everything worked correctly before
                    launching it to the public. Overall, I was able to deliver the project on time, and the event was a
                    success, thanks to the efforts of our team.

                    <h3>The Lifedu</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was tasked with building The Lifedu landing page based on Figma and PSD files provided to me.
                        As part of this project, I collaborated with a team that was split between India and the US,
                        meeting with them weekly to get feedback on my progress. Shradha, our UX Designer, would provide
                        me with additional pages to work on, including the Login page, About Us page, Journal pages, and
                        various emotion pages for kids to express their feelings.

                        <br><br>
                        Meeting deadlines was crucial since Yoshitha would present these pages to stakeholders for
                        review. Through my efforts, I was able to deliver high-quality pages that met the team's needs
                        while also ensuring they were aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and user-friendly.

                    <p>
                        In my role, I was tasked with two projects: to stop emailing users who had yet to complete their
                        registration, and to update the website footer and header with current information.
                        Unfortunately, the documentation provided no information on how to do this, so I had to go back
                        and research the old CMS software, Expression Engine. I scoured ten-year-old comments in files
                        and eventually figured out how the pages worked and where to find them.

                        <br> <br>By completing these
                        tasks, I reduced the number of emails sent by 40%. In addition, I updated our README on Github
                        and created a Notion Page to store all information and links.

                    <h3>NeuroGym Front-End Exercise</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I was tasked with recreating a design in Bootstrap for NeuroGym. Although I
                        hadn't used Bootstrap in a while, I dove into the documentation and quickly reminded myself of
                        how it worked. Using the Figma file provided, I created a responsive website that included a
                        custom modal feature.
                        <br><br>
                        As I worked on this project, I found that my skills in Bootstrap had improved significantly.
                        Additionally, I was able to further develop my problem-solving abilities as I encountered and
                        resolved various issues during the project. Overall, I am proud of the finished product and
                        grateful for the opportunity to expand my skillset.

                        React-Bootstrap for the front end. I am particularly proud of how the site uses web tokens,

                        Additionally, users can view their profile and order history, while the admin panel allows for
                        product and user management and detailed
                        order information, including marking orders as delivered. The site also features a product

                        search, carousel, pagination, and more.
